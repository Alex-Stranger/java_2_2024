Trip Cancellation Risk Calculation Formula and Description

Formula:
Risk = BaseRate × CountryCoefficient × AgeCoefficient × MedicalRiskCoefficient

Where:
1. BaseRate (for example, 55 EUR, can be set by the system).
2. CountryCoefficient - coefficient associated with the country of travel (for example, LATVIA = 1.0, SPAIN = 2.5, JAPAN = 3.5).
3. AgeCoefficient - risk coefficient depending on the age of the tourist
(0-5 age -> 1.1
6-10 age -> 0.7
11-17 age -> 1.0
18-40 age -> 1.1
41-65 age -> 1.2
66-100 age -> 1.5).
4. MedicalRiskCoefficient - a coefficient determined by the selected level of medical risk coverage.

Calculation example:
Country: JAPAN -> CountryCoefficient = 3.5
Age: 70 years -> AgeCoefficient = 1.5
Medical risk level: 20,000 EUR -> MedicalRiskCoefficient = 1.5
Base rate: 55 EUR

Гse the formula:
Risk = 55 × 3.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 = 393.75 EUR

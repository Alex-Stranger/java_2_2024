1. Description of the business task.
To integrate with an external system, it is necessary to upload data for each policy daily
into separate XML files.
Files must contain:
All policy fields, persons, and risks, and also calculated premiums.

2. Technical description of the implementation.

Data upload:
Responsible for selecting data from the database and converting it into a model structure for export.
The data selection will be done in batches to avoid loading all records into memory.

XML generation:
Generates XML files based on prepared data.

File storage and transfer:
Saves XML files to the specified directory and optionally transfers them to an external system.
Each file name must be unique and include policy identifier and date of export.
If a file with the same name already exists in the export directory,
it's behavior must be configurable via application settings.

@Scheduled annotation:
Starts the unloading process.

Feature enabling/disabling:
The export functionality must be configurable and can be enabled or disabled through application settings.
When disabled, the @Scheduler annotation should skip execution, and no files should be generated.

Architectural part:
The export job will be implemented as a separate integration module and will communicate with the core application
 via REST API or internal service interface. The core system remains responsible for providing policy data via an internal API.

3. Testing process.

Unit-tests:
Check error handling when required fields are missing.
Check that the file is written correctly to the file system.

Integration tests:
Checks the interaction between several modules, components, or subsystems
of an application (controllers, services, repositories) and their correct operation together.

Performance testing:
Check the unloading time for large amounts of data.
Check file size and file system load.

4.Running and exploitation the functionality on production.
This section includes instructions on how to start data uploads to production, set up an execution schedule,
check logs, and recover from errors.
